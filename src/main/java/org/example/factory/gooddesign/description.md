## Factory Design Pattern
- You ask the factory for an object (e.g., a Circle or a Rectangle).
- The factory creates the object for you.
- You donâ€™t need to know how the object is created, which makes your code simpler and cleaner.

# Encapsulation:
- The client doesn't need to know the details of object instantiation.

# Flexibility:
- Adding new shapes only requires changes to the factory, not the client code.

# Centralized Control:
- Object creation is managed in one place.
