## The Singleton Design Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global way to access it.
- Think of it like a single power switch in your house—there’s only one, and everyone uses the same one.

# Multiple Instances:
- Anyone can create a new SettingsManager object because the constructor is public.

# No Control:
- The Singleton doesn’t work as expected since multiple instances can be created.

# Inconsistent Behavior:
- You may end up with multiple settings objects, which can cause unexpected behavior.
